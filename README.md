**Commenting and Feedback**
Team members can provide feedback and comments on shared content, facilitating discussion and refinement of ideas. This helps in improving the quality of output and promotes constructive communication.

**Version History**
The app maintains a version history of projects, allowing users to track changes over time and revert to previous versions if needed. This feature enhances transparency and accountability in the collaborative process.

**User Profiles and Permissions**
Each user has a profile with customizable permissions, allowing administrators to control access to specific features and content. This ensures data security and privacy within the app.
